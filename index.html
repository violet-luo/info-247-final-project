      <h3>There're many types of work visas</h3>
      <p>X most common types of work visas are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>H-1B:</b> The H-1B visa is a type of work visa that is granted to foreign workers who have a job offer in a specialty occupation in the United States. A specialty occupation is one that requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialised knowledge, as well as at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent in the specific specialty. Some examples of specialty occupations include IT, engineering, and mathematics. The H-1B visa is valid for up to three years, and can be extended for up to six years. It is one of the most common types of work visas issued in the United States.</li>

      <h3>How your nationality affects your chances of getting approved</h3>
      <p>Your nationality is often a factor of consideration in the approval or denial of your work visa. The most of number of applications come from India by far. But we found the number of applications from a nationality doesn’t seem to be related to the approval rate. </p>

      <h3>Your occupation also plays a role</h3>
      <p>Your occupation determines what type of visa you need to apply for. It also is a factor of consideration in deciding whether your application is accepted or not. </p>

      <p>But let’s dig deeper into how this changes with nationality.</p>

      <p>For each profession, are there preferences for hiring?</p>

      <p>Some companies also have preference for workers from a particular country. </p>
